border-style:solid;">
<h2>The Beginning</h2>

<p>Sophie, a needlewoman who works at her family's hat shop, 
is a responsible-yet-plain 18-year-old girl who goes to Cesari’s 
café to visit her sister Lettie when she encounters by chance a 
mysterious wizard named Howl. This encounter arouses the evil Witch 
of the Waste, who later enters the hat shop and transforms Sophie into 
a 90-year-old woman. As the curse prevents her from telling anyone of 
her condition, Sophie decides to leave her home of Market Chipping and 
seek out a cure out in the waste. 

<br>Along the way, Sophie meets upon the hill the scarecrow Turnip Head. 
She passes the mysterious moving castle and enters it. At this point, 
she meets the enchanted fire demon named Calcifer, who powers the castle 
and recognizes that Sophie has been cursed. Calcifer offers to break the 
curse in exchange for Sophie's help in breaking the spell he's under, 
which keeps Calcifer bound to the house.</br> 

<br>"You promise to help me if I help you?"</br> 
<br>"I don't know, lady. Demons don't make promises."</br> 
<br>"Then go find someone else."</br> 
<br>"Come on! You should feel sorry for me! That spell keeps 
me stuck in this castle, and Howl treats me like I'm his 
slave. It burns me up. You gotta keep the water hot, the 
rooms warm, keep the castle moving. If you can figure out 
how to break this thing I'm in with Howl, then you can break 
my spell. After that, I can easily break the spell that's on you."</br> 
<br>"All right, it's a deal."</br> 

<br>—Sophie making a deal with Calcifer</br> 

 

 

<br>She also meets Howl's young apprentice Markl. 
When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she is 
the castle's new cleaning lady, hired by Calcifer 
because he was sick of how dirty the castle was.</br> 

 

<br>Meanwhile, in Sophie's home country of Ingary, 
the beginning of a war has sparked against another 
neighboring town - following the disappearance of 
the other realm's Crown Prince.</br></p></center>

border-style:solid;">
<h2>Rising Action</h2>

<p>Slowly the war begins to creep into Sophie's 
country itself. Howl receives summons from the 
King, who orders his various assumed identities  
to fight in the war. However, Howl cowers in his 
bedroom and comes up with an idea to send Sophie 
to pose as his mother, announcing that he would be 
useless. At the palace in the capital of Kingsbury, 
Sophie runs into an asthmatic dog, Heen, who she thinks 
is Howl undercover. She also meets the Witch of the Waste, 
who rides on a palanquin carried by two blob men. Magical 
wards disintegrate the Witch's henchmen and she is forced to 
travel by foot. They begin to race up the stairs. 

<br>Once they are inside the castle, Heen and Suliman's servant 
Kosho lead Sophie to the greenhouse while the Witch of The 
Waste finds herself a place to sit down - only to find her 
magical powers drained by Suliman as a punishment. This causes 
her to regress into a harmless old woman with few memories of 
her past actions. Suliman tells Sophie that Howl will meet the same 
fate if he does not contribute to the war. As Sophie vehemently 
protests these measures, the Witch's spell temporarily weakens due 
to the love in her words. This causes Sophie to change briefly to 
her younger self, then regress to her older persona. Madame Suliman 
realizes Sophie's true relation to Howl and her romantic feelings 
towards him. Howl then arrives to rescue Sophie, Suliman tries to 
entrap Howl by summoning star children and revealing his monstrous 
form, but with Sophie's help, they escape. Howl suggests drawing their 
pursuers away as Sophie make her way back to the castle. He offers her 
a magic ring which would help guide her back safely.</br></p></center>

style="border:black; border-width:5px; 
border-style:solid;">
<h2>The Climax</h2>

<p>Sophie learns that Howl is able to 
transform into a bird-like creature to 
interfere in the war, but each transformation 
makes it more difficult for him to return to 
human form. Howl, in an attempt to appease Sophie, 
transforms a part of the castle's into her old home 
by the hat shop, and even shows her a secret garden 
he used to stay in his childhood. Sophie fears that 
Howl is preparing to leave them, as his remaining time 
as a human is limited, and he returns to interfering in 
the war. Sophie's mother Honey shows up under Suliman's 
control and leaves behind a bag containing a "peeping bug" 
under her orders. The former Witch of the Waste discovers it 
and promptly destroys the bug by tossing it into Calcifer who 
gets sick, rendering him unable to conceal the castle. 

 

 

<br>A few hours later, the city is carpet-bombed 
by enemy aircraft while Suliman's Blob men 
invadeThe hat shop. After arriving just in time 
to protect the shop from the bombing, Howl draws 
the guards away after healing Calcifer. He tells 
Sophie he is not going to run away anymore because 
he has something he wants to protect before leaving 
to interfere with the war. Deducing that Howl must be 
saved, Sophie moves everyone out of the castle and removes 
Calcifer from the fireplace, destroying the castle. She offers 
Calcifer some of her braided hair to give him enough strength to 
power a portion of the castle. They head toward Howl when the former 
Witch of the Waste discovers Howl's heart within Calcifer. Sophie pours 
water on Calcifer to make her let go of the heart, making Calcifer lose 
his power. The segment of the castle splits, and she 
and Heen fall down a chasm.</br></p></center>

style="border:black; border-width:5px; 
border-style:solid;">
<h2>Falling Action</h2>

<p>Using her magic ring, Sophie makes her way toward Howl's 
heart, and enters through the door into Howl's childhood. 
She stumbles into his old cottage and looks upon his old 
things. Outside the marshlands, she sees dozens of falling 
starts vanish as they land on the earth. She then sees Howl 
and Calcifer meet: Howl eats Calcifer, who gains his heart. 
Sophie finds Howl, having now lost his human consciousness in 
bird form.</p></center>

style="border:black; border-width:5px; 
border-style:solid;">
<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>They head back to the group, and Sophie 
asks the Witch for Howl's heart. She gives 
it to her and places the heart back in Howl, 
resurrecting him and freeing Calcifer. She 
kisses the scarecrow who reveals that he is 
actually the missing prince. Heen shows the 
scene of their happy end to Suliman, and the 
war is finally over. Howl, Sophie, and the 
others return home from the end of the war, 
flying high above the bomber planes in a moving 
house.</p></center>
